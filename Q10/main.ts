// QS 9.Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least 
// one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because 
// your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current 
// date at the top of each program file. 
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
